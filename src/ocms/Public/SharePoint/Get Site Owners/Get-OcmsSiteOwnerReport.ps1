##############################################################################
# - Script Definition: This script is designed to gather a comprehensive list
# of SharePoint site owners and save them to a .csv file for review. This
# list includes all sites within a tenant.
#
# - Development Date: October 08, 2023
#
# - Limitations:
#     + This script will only gather site owner data for default configured groups.
#     + Custom groups with owners permissions are not yet supported.
#     + Service Limitation: You must be the site collection administrator for all
#       sites you intend on gathering information for.
#     + Some sites may return "Group cannot be found" for sites with custom
#       group names or that which do not have an owners group.
#     + Some sites may return "Access Denied" for those that you do not have
#       permissions to or system level sites.
#     + Owners groups that contain an active directory or security group to apply
#       permissions will be currently listed as the group Object GUID and not the
#       name of the group. This may change in future iterations.
#     + Setting a file name for saving data may write over existing files with the
#       same name. Please check this prior to running. The default save location is
#       the desktop.
