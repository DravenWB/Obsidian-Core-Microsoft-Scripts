# Description: This script is built to reset PUID mismatches for a user that is experiencing issues with sharing files, accessing sites they've been given permissions to, etc.
#
# How it Works: Effectively, this script will remove the user from the User Information List in a SharePoint site or OneDrive entirely by using the Remove-SPOUser command. This
#               will remove 100% of current permissions for that user from the location the script is run against. Data such as files, sites, etc. will remain in place but the
#               user will no longer have access to them until they are added back to the locations, re-shared previously shared documents from that location, etc.
#
# Dependencies: + SharePoint Online PowerShell Module (Version check and installation command included in script.)
#
# Before You Run: Important information to take into consideration before running this script! Please be sure to read these details in their entirety.
#
#               + The operator will need to be a site collection administrator for all locations it is run on. This is required by Get-SPOUser as a check is placed in the script
#                 to see if that user is part of the site/OneDrive before attempting to run the command to remove them.
#
#                 This script is currently configured to add you to any sites/OneDrives you do not currently have site collection permissions for!
#
#                 While this has no currently known major drawbacks, it may look suspicious if logged. Prior to the script finishing, any sites that you were not previously a site 
#                 collection admin of before running will be removed from your account as part of the cleanup process. This information is logged and stored in a text file saved 
#                 by this script for your records locally.
#
#               + For your ease of review, each section has been blocked out using the pound sign (#). Different operations take place within each section.
#
# Terms found within this script:
#
#               + UIL = User Information List (See README.md for more details)
#               + SPO = SharePoint Online
#               + UPN = User Principal Name
#               + PUID = Persistent Unique Identifier (See README.md for more details)
